# **Triage issues**

Triage helps ensure that issues resolve quickly by:

+ Ensuring the issue's intent and purpose is conveyed precisely. This is necessary because it can be difficult for an issue to explain how an end user experiences a problem and what actions they took.

+ Giving a contributor the information they need before they commit to resolving an issue.

+ Lowering the issue count by preventing duplicate issues.

+ Streamlining the development process by preventing duplicate discussions.

This document gives you some ideas on what you can do to help. For more information, read more about [how the core Kindling team triage issues](./how_the_core_kindling_team_triage_issues.md)

## **Improve issues**
Improve issues by suggesting improvements to the title and description. If you think an issue has formatting issues, bad language, or grammatical errors, post a comment to let the author and maintainers know.
## **Report resolved issues**
If you think an issue has been resolved, or is no longer relevant, suggest us to close it. Add a comment on the issue, where you explain the reason it should be closed. Make sure to include any related issues and pull requests.
## **Investigate issues**
Investigate issues that we haven't been able to reproduce yet. In some cases, there are many combinations of panels, dashboards, and data sources that make it difficult for us to reproduce certain issues. Help us by adding more information.



## **Report duplicates**
If you find two issues that describe the same thing, add a comment in one of the issues, with a reference (#<issue number>) to the other. Explain why you think the issue is duplicated.
